## Test Page

---

This is a test page. It allows me to see how different elements appear on my website. On this page you can currently see text paragraphs, lists, headings, dividers, line breaks, images, links, and code blocks. I only support features that are relevant to my website's purpose.

## Paragraphs

---

The font on this website is a monospaced font called DejaVu Sans Mono in size 16. On screens smaller than 500px, the font size is reduced to 12px. The text is justified, and wraps when it reaches the width of the page. Each new paragraph is separated a full line break.

Text on this site can be stylized in the following ways:

*italics*

**bold**

~~strikethrough~~

[underlined links](https://example.com)

## Lists

---

Lists can be created with a hyphen:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

or with numbers:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Block Elements

---

We can create quote blocks:

> In Kyoto, \
> Hearing the cuckoo, \
> I long for Kyoto. \
> \
> **Bashō**

As well as code blocks.

```
Code example:

print("Hello, world!")

- List
- Without
- Formatting
```

These do not format text inside of them, so they work well for in-text drawings:

```
                                                    ┌────────────────────┐
                                                    │     element 1      │
    ┌────────────────────┐                          ├────────────────────┤
    │     element 1      │◄────── connection ──────►│     element 2      │
    ├────────────────────┤                          └────────────────────┘
    │     element 2      │
    ├────────────────────┤
    │     element 3      │
    └────────────────────┘
```

## Media

---

We can show images:

::: image2
- goldfish.webp 
- frogandtoad.webp 
:::

And we can make them show text on hover:

::: image4
- winterlandscape.webp | Winter Landscape - Caspar David Friedrich
- machiavelli.webp | Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli - Santi di Tito
- salutat.webp | Salutat - Thomas Eakins
- day.webp | Day - Agnes Pelton
:::

Or just a single large image:

::: image1
- iceskatingvillage.webp

## Summary

---

This page just exists to keep track of the different stylings on my site. I hope to keep a consistent design style across elements that makes reading easy and enjoyable.
