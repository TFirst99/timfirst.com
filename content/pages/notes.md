1. [This website](https://www.wethesweeple.com/) tells you when street sweeping occurs in Chicago. Useful.

This is increasingly common, and an issue regardless of your stance on any particular topic.

4. New York City maintains a [comprehensive map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/) of all trees in the city.
