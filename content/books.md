- experimentsineconomics.webp | This book is mostly an account of some interesting economic experiments. Not a great resource for any deeper understanding, but entertaining nonetheless.
- gunsgermsandsteel.webp | Guns, Germs, and Steel is more maligned than it deserves. Like every book in its genre, it overstates its claims; regardless, it's informative and thought-provoking.
- whynationsfail.webp | Yes, the econometrics are flawed. Yes, the theory struggles to explain the success of China and India. Yes, you should still read it.
- weirdestpeople.webp | Should be read as a follow-up to Guns, Germs, and Steel and Why Nations Fail. Another attempt at explaining the success of some societies over others, this time with  focus on psychology.
- cows.webp | One of the most disgusting books ever written. Well written.
- beingandtime.webp | This book is terrible. The only reason to read it is the feeling of freedom it provides when you are finally done.
- howelitesate.webp | A leftist's perspective on why leftist movements fail.
- lolita.webp | It's a very good book.
- howthewarwaswon.webp | This book is lauded for a reason. Even if you aren't a history buff, it's worth reading. Note that it is a contrarian account, and not a definitive history.
- philosophicalinvestigations.webp | I wanted to enjoy this more than I did. The style is not conducive to rhetorical clarity. I still think it's worth reading if you are interested in language and meaning.
- abundance.webp | At its best, a fascinating list of governmental failures despite good intentions. At it's worst, a blurry vision for a future that the current American left cannot reach with its current commitments.
- thetrial.webp | I was incredibly upset when I finished this book, mostly because it felt unfinished. A week later I decided that it was one of my favorite books of all time.
- houseofleaves.webp | I've read House of Leaves four times now, and get something new each time. I'm not sure if it's a great work of literature, but it is fun.
- olivertwist.webp | I read Oliver Twist when I was young, and loved it. Charles Dickens should be recommended reading for kids because his books are fun.
- persepolis.webp | An account of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution. Heartbreaking.
- theodyssey.webp | I last read the Odyssey when I was about 10 years old, so I should probably read it again. I remember enjoying it a lot.
- farenheit415.webp | A classic dystopian novel. I'm not sure if science fiction is the best genre for cultural critique or commentary, but it's an enjoyable book.
- theonceandfutureking.webp | A classic fantasy novel. This book is just fun.
