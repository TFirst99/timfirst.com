1. [This website](https://www.wethesweeple.com/) tells you when street sweeping occurs in Chicago. Useful.

2. Design & Architecture firm Sasaki has [a beautiful website](https://www.sasaki.com/).

3. Wikipedia pages like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory) are often dominated by a small group of editors (in this case: [1](https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py?name=Bon+courage&page=COVID-19+lab+leak+theory&max=500&server=enwiki), [2](https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py?name=TarnishedPath&page=COVID-19+lab+leak+theory&max=500&server=enwiki)) who fight to preserve a particular viewpoint. This is increasingly common, and an issue regardless of your stance on any particular topic.

4. New York City maintains a [comprehensive map](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/) of all trees in the city.

5. [Great set of slides (and video)](https://www.nber.org/conferences/si-2025-methods-lecture-uncovering-causal-mechanisms-mediation-analysis-and-surrogate-indices) from Raj Chetty and Kosuke Imai on Mediation Analysis and Surrogate Indices. It's shocking that the video of this presentation only has 1,000 views.
