---

1. [This website](https://www.wethesweeple.com/) tells you when street sweeping occurs in Chicago. Useful.

2. [Design & Architecture firm Sasaki has a beautiful website.](https://www.sasaki.com/)

3. Wikipedia pages like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory) are often dominated by a small group of editors (in this case: [1](https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py?name=Bon+courage&page=COVID-19+lab+leak+theory&max=500&server=enwiki), [2](https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py?name=TarnishedPath&page=COVID-19+lab+leak+theory&max=500&server=enwiki)) who fight to preserve a particular viewpoint. This is increasingly common, and an issue regardless of your stance on any particular topic

4. [New York City maintains a comprehensive map of all trees in the city.](https://tree-map.nycgovparks.org/)

5. [Great set of slides (and video)](https://www.nber.org/conferences/si-2025-methods-lecture-uncovering-causal-mechanisms-mediation-analysis-and-surrogate-indices) from Raj Chetty and Kosuke Imai on Mediation Analysis and Surrogate Indices. It's shocking that the video of this presentation only has 1,000 views.

6. [RSS is awesome](https://evanverma.com/rss-is-awesome) - agreed. I use RSS on my phone and computer to unify my media sources and to avoid platforms that try to control my attention. Substack adding a twitter feed was the last straw for me.

7. [A demonstration of the power of modern CSS.](https://lyra.horse/blog/2025/08/you-dont-need-js/) The website you are currently viewing is a mediocre example of how a nice website can be built without JavaScript.

8. [why lowercase letters save data](https://endtimes.dev/why-lowercase-letters-save-data/) - this article is worryingly full of uppercase letters.

9. [An unorthodox list of ways to make your life better.](https://practicalbetterments.com/) Drill holes in your keys. Cut your toothbrush in half. Rotate your mattress.

10. High resolution satellite imagery is a woefully underutilized resource. The cost of high resolution images [is rapidly dropping](https://landscape.satsummit.io/capture/resolution-considerations.html), but adoption is surprisingly low in economic research. Data processing used to be limitation, but is much easier now with object detection models like [D-FINE](https://github.com/Peterande/D-FINE) or YOLO.
