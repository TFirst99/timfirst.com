I am 23 years old econ predoc. I am interested in economics, artificial intelligence, epistemology, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and more.

I work as a research professional at the University of California, San Diego; however, I live in Chicago, and work out of the University of Chicago. My research focuses on adolescent social media use and its impact on well-being and mental health.
