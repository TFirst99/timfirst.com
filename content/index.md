I am 23 year old econ predoc. My interests include economics, epistemology, philosophy of language, artificial intelligence, philosophy of science, literature, architecture, and more.

I work as a research professional at the University of California, San Diego; however, I live in Chicago, and work out of the University of Chicago. My research focuses on adolescent social media use and its impact on well-being and mental health.

In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and cooking.
